					<p><em> My name is Johnathan</em>, I love you more then anything. <br> You are my heart and soul, and I will never let you go. <br>I am yours always and forever as long as you will have me. <br> Time will heal our wounds and I know that one day everything will be okay. <br> You are my best friend and the only thing that keeps me going. <br> Whatever you need me to be I will be. <br> I will never let what we have go and I will never forgive myself for the person I had become for a night. <br> Please find it in your heart to believe in me and trust that I will change, for you. <br> Without a second though I would give everything for you. <br> You are the most amazing person in this world and you never deserved to be treated like that. <br> I will be successful so that you can have the things that you want, and that I am able to make you happy. <br> Words and apologies will never mend your wounds but please know that I am trying. </p>
